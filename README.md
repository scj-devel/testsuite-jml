testsuite-jml
=============

A JML specification based test suite for SCJ

JML specifications are added to the SCJ implementation for
the HVM, http://www.icelab.dk. To avoid name mismatch,
the packages start with jml, e.g. jml.javax.safetycritical.
For generating test suites from the JML annotated Java files,
JML4c and JMLUnitNG are used.
